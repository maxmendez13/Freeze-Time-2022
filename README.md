# Freeze-Time-2022
Short Unity Platformer made in 2022

I made this game initially playing around with Unity 3D for the first time on my own, outside of tutorials
and my very scuffed game design class I had in high school

This was a submission that I sent to NYU for their consideration as part of my application into Tisch
(I did not get accepted and probably for good reason)

This was finished on January 4 2022


To play, use WASD to move around and the space bar to jump. The goal is to collect all the ice cream
and make it to the refrigerator at the end of the level to make it to the next before the time
hit noon and the ice cream melted

I made everything from scratch including the modeling, the music and audio, and the scripts
